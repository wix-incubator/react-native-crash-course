# JS

The cornerstone of React Native programming is the Javascript language. Take the time to deep dive into it.

## Section Goals
1. Know what is special about JS (compared to other languages)
1. Understand value types and references
1. Understand the concept of closures
1. Understand prototypical inheritance
1. Understand passing callbacks, promises (+ async/await)
1. Understand how functional programming in JS works (high-order functions, map, reduce)

## Interpreters
Find a convenient JS interpreter so you can run stuff and see what you’re getting.

Here are a couple of recommendations:
* [CodePen(supports ES7)](https://codepen.io/)
* [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ )
* [JSPlaygrounds](https://stephengrider.github.io/JSPlaygrounds/)
* Or you can just use the browser DevTools (Chrome or Firefox, for instance)

# The Express Route
Feel like you just need to refresh your knowledge? Or are you a kind of person that likes to dive straight into code and learn on the go?

1. Read the following short guides:
   * [A Simple, Comprehensive Overview of Javascript](https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-single-page-javascript-overview/)
   * [ES6 Guide](https://flaviocopes.com/es6/)
2. [ES2015+ cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/es6) - Go over it and use it.
3. [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) - Achieve code mastery through challenge. Reach [4kyu Rank](https://www.codewars.com/about)
