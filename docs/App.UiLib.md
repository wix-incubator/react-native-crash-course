# Step #3: Style the app (with react native ui lib)

- [x] [**Step #1**: App Navigation (with react-native-navigation)](App.Navigation.md)
- [x] [**Step #2**: App Logic and State Management (with Remx)](App.Remx.md)

## What we're going to do
Though our app works well enough as is, let’s face it - only we think it's beautiful. In this step, we will make our app look stunning with [react-native-ui-lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib).

To that end, we are going to use [react-native-ui-lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib)

## About react-native-ui-lib
[react-native-ui-lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib) is Wix's open source UI toolset & components library for React Native. It is fully maintained by the react-native-ui-lib team at Wix.

It was designed to enable developers to build and customize their own visual language so it is not specific in any way to Wix. The Wix mobile app, for example, is using a private UI library, wix-react-native-ui-lib, as a wrapper around react-native-ui-lib. Most of the components come directly from react-native-ui-lib and are customized to fit the purpose and visual language of the Wix mobile app.

## Prerequisites
1. Follow [these steps](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib/wiki/SETUP) to run the **ui-lib demo project** and play with it for a bit. Go over **Presets**, check out **components and inputs screen**, as well as **lists** and view the **Apple music example**.

1. Read this article about **layout modifiers**: [Easy Layouting with React Native](https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/easy-layouting-with-react-native-b96c4c6fae7) (10 min)

### Useful links
* Make sure to save [react-native-ui-lib docs](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/getting-started/setup) in your bookmarks.

# Getting Started

## 1. Install react-native-ui-lib
In the terminal run: `npm install --save react-native-ui-lib`

## 2. Change to wrapped components
`react-native-ui-lib` provide some wrappers around react-native components (i.e., it takes a normal react-native component and adds to it additional capabilities and styling).
To start things off, change all of your `View` and `Text` imports from **react-native** to **react-native-ui-lib**. <br>
While this is not mandatory, it will give you tools to layout and style your screen easilty with [modifiers](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib/blob/master/docs/foundation/modifiers.md)

# Centralizing the Style of Your Components

Currently, our app is styling each component *separately*. For example, the style object of a title can look something like this:

```js
title: {
    fontSize: 28,
    fontWeight: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? '300':undefined,
    fontFamily: Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'sans-serif-light':undefined,
    color: '#8d007b',
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginTop: 23
  }
```

That's a rather bad way to do it.

> Why? We have lots of duplicate code located all around and we don’t have any control over the style of the app as a whole. Consider working on large app with many developers and designers involved, where each of them can potentially use any style they want for any component! That's way too messy. Every little change, like in the size of all the titles, will require making changes to each screen. Creating a unified visual language includes having strict rules (or "presets") of styling, which determine, for example, the color and typography for ALL components of a certain type.

Luckily, the ui-lib already comes with a set of predefined constants and presets, which define colors, typography, shadows and more. You can easily use these presets anywhere in your code. It's also very easy to [define your own presets](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib/blob/master/docs/foundation/style.md).

## 3. Start using the ui-lib's Presets
There are two ways to use predefined presets from the ui-lib and refactor your app to use them.
**Import presets and use those in the style object:**

```js
import {Colors, Typography} from 'react-native-ui-lib';
...
title: {
    ...Typography.text40,
    color: Colors.purple10,
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginTop: 23
  },
```

**OR Use the ui-lib [modifiers](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib/blob/master/docs/foundation/modifiers.md).**
> As we mentioned in prerequisites, modifiers can be used for layout, but they can also be used for styling. They're quick, readable and require less code.You will find more on using modifiers on components in the docs.

For example, this is how your `ViewPost` screen can look like (we removed the style object completely):

```js
import {Button} from 'react-native';
import {View, Text} from 'react-native-ui-lib';
...
class ViewPost extends Component {
  ...

  render() {
    const {title, text} = this.props.post;

    return (
      <View flex spread padding-24>
        <View>
          <Text text30 purple10>{title}</Text>
          <Text text70 dark20 marginT-12>{text}</Text>
        </View>
        <Button
          title="Delete Post"
          onPress={this.onPostDeletePressed}
          color={'red'}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default ViewPost;
```

All of the changes above can be found in this [commit](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/commit/13d14804630120e38a1d04725cf3959c8ccc1206).

# Playing with the Defaults

## 4. Make the “Delete” button special

The [Button](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/Button/) component is a good example of a simple component in the ui-lib.
You can [see](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/Button/) that it wraps the react-native `TouchableOpacity` component and adds a bunch of props, which together comprise a default styling that you can easily play with. Let's import our `Button` from the ui-lib instead of react-native and give it the following props:

```js
<Button
   label="Delete Post"
   text80
   red20
   bg-red70
   fullWidth
   onPress={this.onPostDeletePressed}
/>
```
Now try to use the `View` component and it's modifier to make the screen look something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/blob/master/assets/deleteButton.png" align="center" height="600px">

## 5. Make your Text Inputs float and open

Import the ui-lib's [`TextField`](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/TextField/) component. Use it to get a "floating" placeholder text for the title and to open a modal which will be used to write in the actual text of the blog post.

```js
 <TextField
  text70
  containerStyle={{marginBottom: 12}}
  floatingPlaceholder
  placeholder="Add a Catchy Title"
  onChangeText={this.onChangeTitle}
  floatOnFocus
/>
<TextField
  text70
  floatingPlaceholder
  placeholder="This is the beginning of a great post"
  onChangeText={this.onChangeText}
  expandable
/>
```

Here is how our `TextField` components should look like now:

## 6. Style your Posts List

Use the ui-lib's [ListItem](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/ListItem/) component. Update your `renderItem` function to give the list some basic styling:

```js
import {Text, ListItem, Colors, BorderRadiuses, Image} from 'react-native-ui-lib';
...

renderItem = ({item}) => (
    <ListItem
      activeBackgroundColor={Colors.purple70}
      activeOpacity={0.1}
      height={77.5}
      onPress={() => this.pushViewPostScreen(item)}
    >
      <ListItem.Part left>
        <Image
          source={{uri: item.img}}
          style={styles.image}
        />
      </ListItem.Part>
      <ListItem.Part middle column containerStyle={[styles.border, {paddingRight: 17}]}>
        <ListItem.Part containerStyle={{marginBottom: 3}}>
          <Text dark10 text70 style={{flex: 1, marginRight: 10}} numberOfLines={1}>{item.title}</Text>
        </ListItem.Part>
        <ListItem.Part>
          <Text style={{flex: 1, marginRight: 10}} text90 dark40 numberOfLines={1}>{item.text}</Text>
        </ListItem.Part>
      </ListItem.Part>
    </ListItem>
  );

  render() {
    return (
      <FlatList
        data={this.props.posts}
        keyExtractor={item => `{key-${item.id}`}
        renderItem={this.renderItem}
      />
    );
  }
}

function mapStateToProps() {
  return {
    posts: postsStore.getPosts()
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(PostsList);

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  image: {
    width: 54,
    height: 54,
    borderRadius: BorderRadiuses.br20,
    marginHorizontal: 14,
  },
  border: {
    borderBottomWidth: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth,
    borderColor: Colors.dark60,
  }
});
```

The [ListItem](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/docs/ListItem/) component is very flexible and was designed to support various styles, this is why the `renderItem` function seems a bit long. You can move it into a separated component, if you like.

As mentioned above, the wix-react-native-ui-lib uses `ListItem` from the ui-lib and applies styling relevant only for the Wix App. So its API will look something like this:
```js
<WixListItem
  title={post.title}
  subtitle={post.text}
  thumbnail={{uri: post.img}}
/>
```

All of the changes above can be found in this [commit](https://github.com/wix-playground/wix-mobile-crash-course/commit/40a676203546bba1b4c0890616457d3af814f029).

## Quick Recap
Up until now:
- You refactored the components of your app to have a **consistent style**.
- You got familiar with a few **react-native-ui-lib components, presets, and modifiers**. You can now go ahead and explore those further to give the app your own look and feel.

This is how our app looks like now:
